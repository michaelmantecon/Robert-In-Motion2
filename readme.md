# Robert in Motion

## Purpose(s)

"Robert in Motion" is a frontend website coded with "vanilla" HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a client who is interested in creating a dual portfolio for his professional projects. 

## Two Purposes, One Site

The client involved in the commissioning of the website has two split projects united under a common theme: disability empowerment and awareness. 

### First Theme

The first theme deals with Robert's Social Media Platform Into The Woods, where he entertains others as a disabled influencer looking to spread awareness and brighten up days.

### Second Theme 

The second theme deals with Robert's pen-making business. There are no online sales for this business but it is a good showcase website for his product. Also he can list where he will have his next sale. 

## Specifications

There are various specifications that initially come to mind for this project, including:

1. A page for each of his different projects
2. An intuitive design that doesn't make the user think too much about navigation
3. A consistent design across the site
4. A modern look (color scheme and functionality)
5. A modern touch given by simple JavaScript effects (transitions,etc...)
6. An area for him to announce where his next pen sales are.
7. A smooth handling of images where the site does not become too cluttered (breathing room)!
8. Links to Robert's social media projects
9. Possibly (?) an embed of one of Robert's videos or social media platforms
10. A way to get in touch (form, WhatsApp, etc...)
